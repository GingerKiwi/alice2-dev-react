She is being chased by the Red Card Soliders. Each turn players can choose to drink from their tea canteen, go forward at moderate speed, rest, go forward at full speed, or check their status.

                  We strongly encourage participation from groups that are under represented in tech. Participants will gain a good understanding of coding with an accessibility first mindset - and as part of the developer experience (DevEx). The game will be developed using semantic html and accessible forms. If you need accommodations, please let us know in the application form (ideally), or during Hacktobrfest.
